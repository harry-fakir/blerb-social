// Look at App.vue for Luna Bear Gallery - the router links and google a tailwind header that collapses to burger menu when on mobile; replace links with router links//

//use the tail wind header with buttons on left side - but increase space x, so it appears on right side  class="space-x-8" instead of sm:space-x-8 for div that contains links//
